Serpent - A All-in-One VRChat mod to suit all your needs using [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader)
# **You need at least MelonLoader v0.5.4**

## Description
A Heavily modified ReModCE with a loads of new features and modified to use the OUR API

If you want a feature or have a bug report, head over to the issues page and create an issue for it!  

NOTE: Avatar Fav lists is auto set to Ares FAV Servers API, down line few updates. we be changing that path to our own Avatar Fav System.

Right now do not save a lot Avatars, because when our API gets made for it. all avatars will dispear and not fully gone for good. always stays with ares mod but our API be made so you might have to Re-Fav everything again.

So far we have our own Custom Nametags API made but more gettign worksed on like adding `IK Tweeks`, `Totally Whosome Intergration` and many more.

## Installation & Usage
Grab the latest loader from [here](https://github.com/ChisVR/ChisClient/releases/latest/Serpent.Loader.dll) and put it in your Mods directory.

By default the loader will attempt to load the mod from your VRChat directory using the filename 'ReModCE.dll'. If it doesn't exist, it will attempt to download the latest Version from GitHub.  
If there is a newer version available on GitHub it will automatically update to that version.  

If you don't want automatic updates, you can open your MelonPreferences.cfg with any text editor and set **ParanoidMode** in the **[Serpent]** category to **true**. That way the loader will notify if there is a new version available, but it won't load it until you download it yourself and replace the old version.  
In case you want to update you can always grab the latest and even previous versions of Serpent.dll [here](https://github.com/ChisVR/ChisClient/releases/).
